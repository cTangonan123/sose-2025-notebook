## Steps to get it running locally
1. fork repository
2. `git checkout -b <new_test_branch_name>`
3. bash command: `yarn` to install dependencies
	1. note: `node` version current for build is between 18-22, [#]
		- I have the latest npm installed, So i had to use `nvm`
			- if you don't have `nvm` installed, [link to nvm repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### in case you have the latest `npm` 
use `nvm` in order to downgrade your node version
- if you don't have `nvm` installed, [link to repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
after running the curl or wGet command for installation, open new terminal
- downgrade your node version
```bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22 # using the latest version possible

node -v # check to ensure your node version has changed
```
*after this step you should be able to run the `yarn` command without issue*

### in order to serve and see what the application looks like
```bash
yarn start
```
